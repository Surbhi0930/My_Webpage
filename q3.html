        <h1>JAVA</h1>
        <P>
            Java has been one of the most popular programming language for many years.Java is object oriented.
             However it is not considered as pure object oriented as it provides support for primitive data type 
             types(like int,char,etc) The java codes are first compiled into byte ode(machine independent code).
             Then the byte code is run on Java Virtual Kachine(JVM) regardless of the underlying architecture.
